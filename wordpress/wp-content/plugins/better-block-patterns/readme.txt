Build better WordPress websites faster with our custom block patterns for the Block Editor (Gutenberg).


== Description ==

<strong>Build better WordPress websites faster with our custom block patterns for the Block Editor (Gutenberg).</strong>

[Better Block Patterns](https://www.ilovewp.com/better-block-patterns/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link) extends the WordPress Block Editor with numerous custom block patterns that can be used with any WordPress theme. 

From portfolios, pricing tables, hotel room pages, user testimonials, to staff directories and more, we make creating these pages easier.
