								<h3>Bittersweet Surprises</h3>
								<p>After a long year of changes. We had good (but very unexpected) news. We're having a baby. This was quickly shared with our families. And as it turns our this was none too soon. It was the last conversation we had with my mom before she became unresponseive and passed away a week later.

								</p>
									It's been a busy time since then as we settle into a new normal and moved into a larger house to accomidate our new family size. We celebrated with our friends and family that we are having another girl with a raucus party.
