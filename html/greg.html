								<h3>My Eulogy</h3>
								<p>
									Greg Faulconbridge was born as a small-town, Western Pennsylvanian but he didn’t stay that way.
									After being born in Greenville, PA and raised in Grove City, PA he really spread his wings and ended up at Grove City College before graduating and moving to Reedsville, PA, Harrisburg, PA and Erie, PA.
 									Although it took him a while to grow into it, we all remember him for his generous, fun-loving, adventurous nature. </p>
								<p>
									As a young man he had several early experiences with the magic of theater that never quite left him as he aged, even if he wasn’t as active with it.
									First as a Munchkin in a local production of <i>Wiz of the West</i> (a western flavored Wizard of Oz).
									Then as the lead, Prince Llewellyin, in a middle school production of <i>Let Your Hair Down, Rapunzel</i>, where he was best remembered for not being able to remember his lines to his big solo song so he wrote them on his hand only for them to smudge and become illegible and for the premise of growing hair on eggs to create Rupunzel’s long locks.
									He seemed to peak early in his acting career by protra the butler in Anne Jr and a chorus member in Footloose, but he soon found his true theatrical calling.
									He decided to stand behind the lights instead of in front of them.
									He became active in lighting, sound, and stage management for the rest of this time in high school and college.
									While in college he was the lighting designer for the production of Le Bete that was recognized nationally by being invited to perform at the Kennedy Center for the Arts in Washington, DC.
								</p>
								<p>
									After high school he matriculated to Grove City College where he studied EE.
									Whether that was electrical engineering or Emily Ellis I’ll leave to you to decide.
									Greg was a proud and active member of the Adelphikos fraternity on campus and maintained close ties with his brothers for many years after with annual trips and many humorous email messages.
								</p>
								<p>
									After college Greg began working in Lewistown, PA where he developed his love for the outdoors - rock climbing, cycling, kayaking, and camping - and service - Habitat for Humanity, YMCA, Urban University - that characterized the remainder of his life.  
								</p>
								<p>
									Greg was blessed to marry his college sweetheart of 6 years in 2012 and they spent the remaining 65 years building an active life together.
									They had 2 daughters and 270 grandchildren.
									As we all remember, Greg loved to cook.
									Always joking that he usually cooked to make it harder for Emily to slip something toxic into his food. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Even with a young family, Greg and Emily’s love of adventure couldn’t hold them back.
									Once their children were old enough they traveled extensively.
									Always wanting to have Ella and Lily experience everything our country and world could offer them.
									They traveled the United States for several years and visited every National Park and Monument as a family. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Greg is a gifted inventor who has created several products that make the world a better place.
									And through his businesses he was able to create a financial legacy for this family.
									He was able to completely fund his children and grandchildren’s education and launch his children into life, supporting them as they found their calling.
									Greg and Emily were also able to fund an endowment to continue his legacy of charitable service for generations to come. 
								</p>
								<p>
									But more than anything Greg was one to know when enough was enough.
									He quit his full time work at 40 when he realized his time and good health were more precious to him than any paycheck.
									He used that ‘retirement’ to serve communities in need.
									Traveling to where there was a need and servicing until called to another field of mission.
									Everyone he knew can attest to his deep and abiding faith and how he lived it out daily with his friends, family and community. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Those of us fortunate enough to call ourselves friends with Greg are mourning a great loss.
									We may not be many but Greg was such a deep and true friend that he would have laid down his life for any one of us without hesitation and we would have done the same for him.
									We will all surely miss his wit and the way he could listen to you talk for hours as only a friend could. 
								</p>

								<h4>All the Other Stuff</h4>
								<p>Greg loves board games with friends. Some of his current favorites include:
									<ul>
										<li>Splendor (and Cities expansions)</li>
										<li>Seven Wonders Duel</li>
										<li>Night of the Ninja</li>
										<li>Cash and Guns</li>
										<li>Hellopagos</li>
										<li>Cribbage</li>
										<li>Codenames</li>
									</ul> 
								</p>
								
								<hr />
								
								<p>Greg currently invests in real estate and is always open to new opportunities in:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Erie, PA</li>
									<li>Birmingham, AL</li>
								</ul>
								
								<hr />
							
								<p>Greg is interested in purchasing a business in need of technical or operational leadership.
									<ul>
										<li>It should generates between $400,000 and $1,000,000 EBITDA.</li>
										<li>It should be located in the Western Pennsylvania or Eastern Ohio region.</li>
										<li>I am not interested in:</li>
										<ul class="nested">
											<li>food service businesses</li>
											<li>automotive businesses (gas station, auto dealership, mechanic/oil change shop, etc)</li>
											<li>trucking/delivery company (FedEx Route, bread delivery, etc)</li>
											<li>fitness businesses</li>
											<li>adult/child care businesses</li>
											<li>eCommerce business</li>
										</ul>
										<li>I feel I would best fit into a manufacturer's or distributor's operation</li>
										<li>It should have a diversified and recurring customer base</li>
									</ul>

									Any leads toward this objective would be most appreciated.
